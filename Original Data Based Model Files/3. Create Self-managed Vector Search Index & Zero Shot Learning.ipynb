exhaust gas recirculation data valid but above normal operating range moderetly severe level, got onto cummins EDS and started by checking primary fault codes but none matched , nextstep was to check service bulliton and follow buliton steps , pulled sensor and checked for soot or clocked issues but found none senser was clean and so was intake, next was to perform an air handleing performance test , took a while to get a laptop with cummins to do this test so while waiting had truck running to get to correct temp to perform test, passed air handling performance test and code did not further become active but instead had another cod become active 0687 Turbocharger 1 speed  data valid but below normal operating range  moderetly severe level, starded trouble shooting on eds started by checking for primary fault codes but none were active, then had to remove intake manifold pressure sensor and inspect for soot bulidup or broken or damaged but sensor was clean and was in good condition, next had to check if sensor was reading within spec and it was, it was reading 0 psi as it should so determined sesor was good, next had to remove engine air filter housing in order to remove turbo speed sensor, removed and inpected was in good conditions, next had to ohm out sensor, sensor ohmed out within spec, next had to ohm out signal and return pins at sensor connection, ohmed out within spec, next had to ohm out signal pin to engine block ground , also within spec , then had to remove ecm connector in order to ohm out both the signal and return wires to ecm connecter ohmed out both and both were within spec, net had to ohm out ecm connector harness pin 17 sinal pin to ground and it was within spec, then had to ohm out same 17 pin with all other pins in that connector to but every single pin was within spec, next had to check for an ecm calibration for this code but there was none , since everything checked was in spec last step was to rplace turbo speed sensor, went to parts got sensor installed new sensor, reinstalled air filter housing and had truck running oitside of bay for but 45 minutes with no issues but will need a test drive to verify EPR Part

Following this, we performed zero, one and few shot learning and ranking of results and extracted prediction using Approach 2: Get label of top most matching claim, ran this model on test claims and wrote the predictions into a delta table for consumption through UI."
